                <h4>What Is SMO?</h4>
              </div>
              <div className="">
                SMO stands for social media optimization. It could also stand
                for search marketing optimization but social media is what it is
                better known for. Social media is a big thing in digital
                marketing these days and even search engines give better weight
                to social media content making it very important for businesses.
                <br />
                Social media encompasses not only the most popular social media
                sites but also blogs and forums where people interact. SMO is a
                vital tool to build a strong brand presence and increase
                visibility in an organic way through social media channels. SMO
                services handle your social media accounts and populate pages
                with the right content, promote it among groups, create the
                strong following and build trust in your brand. Dozens of SMO
                companies in India offer SEO and SMO services but choosing the
                right one is important if you wish to build a strong presence in
                social channels and get better rankings.
