                Pay per Click or PPC as it is known is a program offered by most
                leading search engines, notably Google. This is how it works.
                You sign up for the pay per click program. You then create a
                text ad with the use of specific keywords. The ad will be
                displayed on search engine results whenever a user uses the
                keywords you have chosen. Such ads are usually listed at the top
                and differentiated from general search results. The ads may
                appear on the side too. If a visitor on the search result page
                chooses to click on your ad then your account will be debited by
                the charge for each click. It is also known as search engine
                marketing and you would need to engage in search engine
                marketing services to create a PPC campaign for your company.

                services that match chosen keywords. PPC targets those who are
                looking for products or services that you offer and it can
                result in an immediate lead generation.

                  PPC is broader in definition since it has spread beyond the
                  simple text ads. PPC success relies on a variety of factors
                  such as the use of the right set of keywords, time to display
                  the ads and the geographic location as well. PPC also includes
                  display ads through Google’s display network, a program in
                  which Google displays ads on a number of websites in order to
                  target specific audiences. This program works in a way that is
                  similar to its AdSense program. PPC also includes remarketing,
                  a process in which website visitors have a cookie placed on
                  their system by the website. The cookie tracks the user’s web
                  behaviors and targets specific ads when they visit other
                  websites.
